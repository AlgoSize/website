**Social Media and EdgeRank Algorithm**

**What is Social Media?**
Social media refers to online platforms and websites that enable users to create and share content or participate in social networking. It's a space that facilitates interactive discussions, content sharing, and community creation among its users. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn are prevalent examples of social media, each offering varied social interaction models.

**How Does EdgeRank Algorithm Work?**
EdgeRank is an algorithm developed by Facebook to determine where and what posts appear on each individual user's News Feed. The main goal is to optimize user experience by showcasing content that is relevant and engaging to them. EdgeRank considers several factors:
- **Affinity Score**: Measures the relationship between the user and the content/source. More interaction (likes, comments, shares) with a person or page will increase the score.
- **Weight**: Different types of posts (photos, videos, status updates) carry different weights, with more engaging content types typically carrying more weight.
- **Time Decay**: As a post ages, it loses relevance and is less likely to appear in a user’s News Feed.
These factors combined decide the ranking and visibility of the posts in a user’s News Feed.
