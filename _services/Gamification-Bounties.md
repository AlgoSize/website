### **Algosize Bounty Scoring System**

Our gamification system ranks hackers based on their performance across three key metrics: **number of bounties won**, **sum of bounty rewards**, and **problem complexity**. Here's how it works:

---

### **Scoring Criteria**

1. **Number of Bounties Won (30% of total score)**  
   - Each bounty successfully claimed adds to the hacker's score. The more bounties won, the higher the ranking.
   - Scoring:
     - 1-5 bounties: 10 points per bounty
     - 6-10 bounties: 15 points per bounty
     - 11+ bounties: 20 points per bounty

2. **Sum of Bounties Earned (40% of total score)**  
   - The total monetary value of bounties collected influences the ranking, incentivizing high-value bounty wins.
   - Scoring:
     - $0 - $5,000: 1 point per $100 earned
     - $5,001 - $20,000: 2 points per $100 earned
     - $20,001+: 3 points per $100 earned

3. **Problem Complexity (30% of total score)**  
   - Bounties are classified into different levels of complexity. Hackers tackling more complex challenges will earn higher points.
   - Scoring:
     - Low complexity: 50 points
     - Medium complexity: 100 points
     - High complexity: 200 points

### **Rankings & Bonuses**

- **Leaderboard**: Hackers are ranked based on their cumulative score from all three categories.
- **Bonus Multiplier**: Winning a hackathon or high-tier challenge grants a 1.5x multiplier on the sum of bounties and complexity points for that event.

### **Example Calculation**

If a hacker wins 8 bounties, totaling $12,000, and 3 of those bounties were high complexity, hereâ€™s how their score is calculated:

- **Number of Bounties**: 8 bounties = 15 points x 8 = **120 points**
- **Sum of Bounties**: $12,000 = ($5,000 x 1 point) + ($7,000 x 2 points) = **19 points**
- **Problem Complexity**: 3 high complexity = 200 points x 3 = **600 points**

**Total Score = 120 + 19 + 600 = 739 points**
