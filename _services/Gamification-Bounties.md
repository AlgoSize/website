### **Algosize Bounty Scoring System**
<br/>
<br/>
Our gamification system ranks hackers based on their performance across several key metrics: **number of bounties won**, **sum of bounty rewards**, **problem complexity**, and **community participation on Discord**. Here’s how it works:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
### **Scoring Criteria**
<br/>
<br/>
1. **Number of Bounties Won (30% of total score)**
   - Each bounty successfully claimed adds to the hacker’s score. The more bounties won, the higher the ranking.
   - **Scoring**:
     - 1-5 bounties: 10 points per bounty
     - 6-10 bounties: 15 points per bounty
     - 11+ bounties: 20 points per bounty
<br/>
<br/>
2. **Sum of Bounties Earned (40% of total score)**  
   - The total monetary value of bounties collected influences the ranking, incentivizing high-value bounty wins. This scoring system offers greater rewards for higher sums.
   - **Scoring**:
     - $0 - $5,000: 2 points per $100 earned
     - $5,001 - $20,000: 4 points per $100 earned
     - $20,001+: 6 points per $100 earned
<br/>
<br/>
3. **Problem Complexity (30% of total score)**
   - Bounties are classified into different levels of complexity. Hackers tackling more complex challenges will earn higher points.
   - **Scoring**:
     - Low complexity: 50 points
     - Medium complexity: 100 points
     - High complexity: 200 points
<br/>
<br/>
4. **Community Participation on Discord (Bonus Points)**
   - **#dev-chats**: Providing valuable support and guidance on development-related questions or discussions.
     - **Scoring**: Each useful contribution: 3 points (as determined by team moderators)
   - **#code-reviews**: Reviewing and providing useful feedback on code shared by fellow hackers.
     - **Scoring**: Each approved review: 5 points (as deemed valuable by team moderators)
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
### **Rankings & Bonuses**
<br/>
<br/>
- **Leaderboard**: Hackers are ranked based on their cumulative score from all criteria.
- **Bonus Multiplier**: Winning a hackathon or high-tier challenge grants a 1.5x multiplier on the sum of bounties and complexity points for that event.

### **Example Calculation**
<br/>
<br/>
If a hacker wins 8 bounties totaling $12,000, 3 of which were high complexity, and provides 3 useful contributions on **#dev-chats** and 2 approved code reviews on **#code-reviews**, here’s how their score is calculated:
<br/>
<br/>
- **Number of Bounties**: 8 bounties = 15 points x 8 = 120 points
- **Sum of Bounties**:  
  - First $5,000 = $5,000 x 2 points per $100 = 100 points  
  - Remaining $7,000 = $7,000 x 4 points per $100 = 280 points  
  - **Total from Sum of Bounties** = 100 + 280 = **380 points**
- **Problem Complexity**: 3 high complexity bounties = 200 points x 3 = 600 points
- **Community Participation**:  
  - 3 useful contributions on **#dev-chats** = 3 points x 3 = 9 points  
  - 2 approved code reviews on **#code-reviews** = 5 points x 2 = 10 points
<br/>
<br/>
**Total Score = 120 + 380 + 600 + 9 + 10 = 1,119 points**
