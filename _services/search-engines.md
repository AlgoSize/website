**Search Engines**

A search engine is a software application designed to search for information on the World Wide Web. Its results are typically presented in a line referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs). The information may be a mix of web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and various other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Examples include Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.

**How PageRank Algorithm Works**

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. The algorithm works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of the website's importance. The fundamental principle is that more important websites are likely to be more valuable and useful than others.

PageRank works by considering the 'votes' cast for it by other pages. The more links 'voting' for a page (linking to it), the more important it's considered. Additionally, the importance of the page that is casting the vote determines how important the vote itself is. PageRank is calculated for individual pages, meaning that each page on a site can have its own PR score.

**Providing PageRank Algorithm Development Services**

As an Algorithm Development Firm:
