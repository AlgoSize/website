### **How to Gain Voting Power**
<br/>
<br/>
**Voting Power** is reserved for the **best performers** in our system. To earn it, you’ll need to prove your skills across three critical metrics: the **number of bounties won**, the **sum of bounty rewards**, and the **complexity of the problems** you solve.
<br/>
<br/>
Here’s a breakdown of how our **Algosize Bounty Scoring System** works:
<br/>
<br/>
1. **Number of Bounties Won (30% of total score)**  
   The more bounties you win, the more points you earn.  
   - **Scoring**:  
     - 1-5 bounties: 10 points per bounty  
     - 6-10 bounties: 15 points per bounty  
     - 11+ bounties: 20 points per bounty
<br/>
<br/>
2. **Sum of Bounties Earned (40% of total score)**  
   The total value of your bounty rewards also affects your score, encouraging you to aim for high-value wins.  
   - **Scoring**:  
     - $0 - $5,000: 2 points per $100 earned  
     - $5,001 - $20,000: 4 points per $100 earned  
     - $20,001+: 6 points per $100 earned
<br/>
<br/>
3. **Problem Complexity (30% of total score)**  
   Tackling more complex problems earns you significantly higher points.  
   - **Scoring**:  
     - Low complexity: 50 points  
     - Medium complexity: 100 points  
     - High complexity: 200 points
<br/>
<br/>
4. **Bonus Multipliers**  
   Winning a hackathon or high-tier challenge gives you a **1.5x multiplier** on both the sum of your bounties and the complexity points for that event, boosting your score even further.
