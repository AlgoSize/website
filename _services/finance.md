**Finance and Algorithmic Trading**

**What is Finance?**
Finance refers to the management, creation, and study of money and investments. It encompasses a broad range of activities such as the management of money, banking, investments, credit, and other financial instruments. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and expected rate of return, and it plays a crucial role in various aspects like capital markets, personal budgeting, and corporate financing.

**How Does Algorithmic Trading Work?**
Algorithmic Trading, often referred to as algo-trading or black-box trading, involves using computer algorithms and complex formulas to make trading decisions, manage and execute orders, and optimize trading goals. It enables trading large orders and markets without significant price changes, hence maintaining market stability. Algo-trading can be based on pre-set variables like time, price, quantity, or any mathematical model that helps in making a profitable trading decision without human intervention. Advantages involve executing trades at the best possible prices, timely trade order placement, reduced transaction costs, and the avoidance of significant price alterations.
