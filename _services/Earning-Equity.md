We believe in rewarding hackers not just with immediate payouts, but with long-term opportunities that allow them to grow alongside the company. Our **Equity Earning Strategy** empowers hackers to reinvest their bounty winnings back into the company, increasing their stake in the future of Algosize.

### **How It Works**
<br/>
<br/>
When a hacker team wins a bounty, they are presented with two choices:
- **Claim the bounty in full**: Receive the bounty as an immediate reward.
- **Reinvest the bounty**: Choose to reinvest part or all of the bounty back into the company in exchange for equity.
<br/>
<br/>
By reinvesting your bounty, you don’t just take home a bigger stake in Algosize, you also **earn more points** in our **Gamification Scoring System**, which unlocks exclusive benefits such as:
- **Paid travel expenses** to global hackathons and cybersecurity events
- Access to **advanced hardware and software** to support your future endeavors
- **Increased visibility** and influence within the Algosize hacker community
<br/>
<br/>
As the company grows, so does the value of your equity. After holding your equity for one year, you’ll have the opportunity to retrieve your investment with its appreciated value.

### **Reinvest for More Than Equity**
<br/>
<br/>
While earning equity helps you build wealth, it also plays a crucial role in your overall **scoring and reputation** within the company. Reinvesting not only boosts your status on the leaderboard, but it gives you access to **key resources** and perks that will help you excel in future challenges. These resources include everything from **cutting-edge tech tools** to fully funded trips to prestigious hackathons.

### **Voting Power for Top Performers**
<br/>
<br/>
While reinvesting gives you a financial stake in Algosize, **voting power** is reserved for the top-scoring hackers. Each year, the highest-ranking hackers based on bounty wins, reinvestment, and overall performance will be awarded **voting rights**. With these rights, you can:
- Participate in major **company decisions**
- Help shape Algosize's future by influencing strategy and operations
- Vote on the selection of **board members** who will steer the company towards success
