**Navigation and Pathfinding Algorithms**

**What is Navigation?**
Navigation refers to the process of planning, controlling, and executing the movement from one point to another. In the context of software and technology, navigation is used in various industries, such as logistics, automotive, and robotics, to provide optimal paths, ensure accurate location tracking, and facilitate efficient movement or data retrieval.

**How Do Pathfinding Algorithms Work?**
Pathfinding algorithms identify the shortest, most efficient, or otherwise optimal path between two points. These algorithms take into account various factors such as distance, cost, and obstacles to determine the best route. Some renowned pathfinding algorithms include Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A* (A Star), and Bellman-Ford Algorithm, which explore possible paths and select the one that minimizes or optimizes specific criteria (e.g., total cost, distance, or time).
