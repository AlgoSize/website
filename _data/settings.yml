  description: We operate where standard security fails. From hardening AI clusters against prompt injection and model extraction to securing multi-million dollar blockchain protocols via formal verification, Algosize architects systems that are resilient by design. We don't just patch vulnerabilities; we eliminate attack vectors through mathematical optimization.
