🎉 **We’re thrilled to announce that we’ve won the Privacy Track at ZK Hack Montreal!** 🎉
<br>
<br>

🏆 **Prize**: $1,000  
💻 **Track**: NovaNet - Privacy  
🌐 **Project**: [Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning with Zero-Know](https://devfolio.co/projects/privacypreserving-machine-learning-with-zeroknow-5c34)
<br>
<br>

Our project, **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning with Zero-Know**, focused on tackling privacy issues in sensitive data environments like healthcare and finance. By using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, we’ve enabled secure collaboration without exposing sensitive data, ensuring **privacy** and **security** in critical industries.
<br>
<br>

🔒 **What We Built**:  
Using NovaNet's **zkEngine** with privacy enabled, we developed a **zkWasm app** that empowers privacy-centric use-cases. Our solution ensures **trustless collaboration**, allowing multiple parties to perform machine learning and data analysis **without sharing sensitive data**. This innovation opens new doors for cooperation in industries where data security is paramount, enabling more efficient and secure outcomes.

🚧 **Challenges We Faced**:  
While working on this project, we encountered challenges with **proof aggregation**, a feature we plan to tackle in the future once the NovaNet library further evolves. We're excited to explore new folding schemes for improved interoperability down the line.
